Here are the exact column names from each file:

- **Inventory Table**:
  - `Store_ID`
  - `Product_ID`
  - `Stock_On_Hand`

- **Products Table**:
  - `Product_ID`
  - `Product_Name`
  - `Product_Category`
  - `Product_Cost`
  - `Product_Price`

- **Sales Table**:
  - `Sale_ID`
  - `Date`
  - `Store_ID`
  - `Product_ID`
  - `Units`

- **Stores Table**:
  - `Store_ID`
  - `Store_Name`
  - `Store_City`
  - `Store_Location`
  - `Store_Open_Date`

Now that we have the column names, we can proceed to write the SQL queries to answer your questions. Here are the queries for each question:

---

### **1. Total sales revenue generated by each store:**
```sql
SELECT s.Store_ID, SUM(p.Product_Price * sa.Units) AS Total_Sales_Revenue
FROM sales sa
JOIN products p ON sa.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
JOIN stores s ON sa.Store_ID = s.Store_ID
GROUP BY s.Store_ID;
```

### **2. Top-selling products in terms of units sold:**
```sql
SELECT p.Product_Name, SUM(sa.Units) AS Total_Units_Sold
FROM sales sa
JOIN products p ON sa.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
GROUP BY p.Product_Name
ORDER BY Total_Units_Sold DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### **3. Sales performance by product category:**
```sql
SELECT p.Product_Category, SUM(p.Product_Price * sa.Units) AS Total_Sales
FROM sales sa
JOIN products p ON sa.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
GROUP BY p.Product_Category;
```

### **4. Current inventory levels for each product at each store:**
```sql
SELECT s.Store_Name, p.Product_Name, i.Stock_On_Hand
FROM inventory i
JOIN stores s ON i.Store_ID = s.Store_ID
JOIN products p ON i.Product_ID = p.Product_ID;
```

### **5. Monthly sales trends across different stores:**
```sql
SELECT s.Store_Name, DATE_FORMAT(sa.Date, '%Y-%m') AS Month, SUM(p.Product_Price * sa.Units) AS Total_Sales
FROM sales sa
JOIN products p ON sa.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
JOIN stores s ON sa.Store_ID = s.Store_ID
GROUP BY s.Store_Name, Month;
```

### **6. Stores with highest and lowest sales performance:**
```sql
SELECT s.Store_Name, SUM(p.Product_Price * sa.Units) AS Total_Sales
FROM sales sa
JOIN products p ON sa.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
JOIN stores s ON sa.Store_ID = s.Store_ID
GROUP BY s.Store_Name
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;
```

### **7. Profit margin for each product:**
```sql
SELECT p.Product_Name, (p.Product_Price - p.Product_Cost) / p.Product_Price * 100 AS Profit_Margin
FROM products p;
```

### **8. Sales distribution across different cities:**
```sql
SELECT st.Store_City, SUM(p.Product_Price * sa.Units) AS Total_Sales
FROM sales sa
JOIN stores st ON sa.Store_ID = st.Store_ID
JOIN products p ON sa.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
GROUP BY st.Store_City;
```

### **9. Products out of stock in each store:**
```sql
SELECT s.Store_Name, p.Product_Name
FROM inventory i
JOIN stores s ON i.Store_ID = s.Store_ID
JOIN products p ON i.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
WHERE i.Stock_On_Hand = 0;
```

### **10. Sales variation by specific dates:**
```sql
SELECT sa.Date, SUM(p.Product_Price * sa.Units) AS Total_Sales
FROM sales sa
JOIN products p ON sa.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
GROUP BY sa.Date
ORDER BY sa.Date;
```

### **11. Average cost of products in each category:**
```sql
SELECT p.Product_Category, AVG(p.Product_Cost) AS Avg_Cost
FROM products p
GROUP BY p.Product_Category;
```

### **12. Sales growth over time for the entire company:**
```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(sa.Date, '%Y-%m') AS Month, SUM(p.Product_Price * sa.Units) AS Total_Sales
FROM sales sa
JOIN products p ON sa.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month;
```

### **13. Impact of store open date on sales performance:**
```sql
SELECT s.Store_Name, s.Store_Open_Date, SUM(p.Product_Price * sa.Units) AS Total_Sales
FROM sales sa
JOIN products p ON sa.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
JOIN stores s ON sa.Store_ID = s.Store_ID
GROUP BY s.Store_Name, s.Store_Open_Date
ORDER BY s.Store_Open_Date;
```

### **14. Percentage of total sales by each store:**
```sql
SELECT s.Store_Name, 
       SUM(p.Product_Price * sa.Units) / (SELECT SUM(p.Product_Price * sa.Units) FROM sales sa JOIN products p ON sa.Product_ID = p.Product_ID) * 100 AS Sales_Percentage
FROM sales sa
JOIN products p ON sa.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
JOIN stores s ON sa.Store_ID = s.Store_ID
GROUP BY s.Store_Name;
```

### **15. Sales compared to current stock levels for each product:**
```sql
SELECT p.Product_Name, SUM(sa.Units) AS Total_Units_Sold, i.Stock_On_Hand
FROM sales sa
JOIN products p ON sa.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
JOIN inventory_inventory i ON sa.Product_ID = i.Product_ID
GROUP BY p.Product_Name, i.Stock_On_Hand;
```

You can use these queries in your MySQL Workbench to retrieve the requested information.
